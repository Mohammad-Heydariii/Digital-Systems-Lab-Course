# Digital-Systems-Lab-Course
during this Lab in first stage we design and implement some of digital circuits such as Function Generator, SOC Clock Generation using modelsim and after we are going to design these blocks in Quartus software using logics , hardware and some simple components which integrate all in a single chip.
(for more info about implementations and also project results read final-report pdf file has been attached for every single part )
